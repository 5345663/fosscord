## Motivation

Fosscord aims to be a full one-on-one clone of Discord, adding more features that can be used as a replacement for the official client and still connect and host private Fosscord server instances.

Fosscord aims to give the best possible user experience, while being backwards compatible to Discord's features and adding new ones/improving old ones.

The client can connect to multiple server instances without the need to open it multiple times.

The client should be extensible through a secure Plugin and Theme System with own store.

The server should be extensible through bots, just like discord without the need to change anything except the api endpoint.

The project is open source so everyone can have a look what's going on under the hood and can be maintained and expanded by the community.

Everything is configurable in the server config and everyone can add their own features, so that it is not opinionated. 

## Support
